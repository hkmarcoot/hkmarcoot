### Hi there, I am a School Of Code Bootcamp Alumni! ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the University Of Code daily coding challenge as part of my 2nd 100 days of code challenge. To view my progress, please check out my [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/marcotsang112) and my [GitHub repo](https://github.com/hkmarcoot/100-days-of-code-2nd/tree/main/universityOfCode).

- ðŸ‘¯ I was a STEM Tutor and an IT Teaching Assistant day back in my HK life. I have a [STEM course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/scratch-3-learn-by-17-games-with-4-tactics/) teaching about game making using the MIT Scratch, which summarises what I learned and taught to students as a STEM Tutor.
